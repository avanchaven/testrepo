The Base64 online converter supports both functions of the algorithm on same page. If you need to encode a text to Base64, fill in the “Text” field and press “Encode text to Base64” — the result will appear in the “Base64” field. Otherwise, if you have a Base64 string, paste it into the “Base64” field and press “Decode Base64 to text” — the result will appear in the “Text” field.
